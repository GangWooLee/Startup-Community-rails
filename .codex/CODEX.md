# Codex Context - Startup Community Platform

This directory mirrors the project's `.claude` assets so Codex can reuse the same
reference docs, standards, workflows, and skills.

Start here:
- PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
- ARCHITECTURE_DETAIL.md
- DESIGN_SYSTEM.md

Mirrors (symlinks):
- agents/
- commands/
- plans/
- references/
- rules/
- skills/
- standards/
- workflows/

Notes:
- Source of truth stays in `.claude/`.
- Update docs there; links here reflect changes automatically.
